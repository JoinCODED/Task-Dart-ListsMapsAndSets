# Maps And Sets üó∫Ô∏è

### Lists

Given this list of integers: `[5, 3, 15, 4, 1]`.
Using a `for` loop count the sum of those elements.

### Sets

Given two integer sets `a` and `b`, calculate the set of the elements that belong to either `a` or `b`, but not both.

Example, given the following:

```dart
const a = { 3, 5 };
const b = { 5, 7 };
```

Output:

```
 {3, 7}
```

### Maps

Given the following map of a restaurant menu:

```dart
const menu = {
  'burger': 6.5,
  'pizza': 5,
  'water': 1.5,
};
```

Calculate the total for a given order.

Example:

```dart
const order = ['pizza', 'water'];
```

Output:

```
Total: $6.5
```

and if an order element is not on the menu, the output should be:

```
rice is not on the menu
```
